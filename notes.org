* Emacs Configuration Notes

*** TODO 
- Map =C-`= and =C-~= to shell related command.
- Map Flymake next/prev error
  - Map indent/unindent line key
- Map kill buffer to some more convenient key(such as =M-k= or =S-k=)
- Remap =query-replace=
- Map go next/prev ring in buffer
- Ispell
- =crux-upcase/downcase= also works without selection for one character.
- Fix wired indentations
  - In org-mode, c mode, elisp mode
  
** Keymap
*** Unused keys
- =M-u,l,i,t,j,h,m,q,a,e=
- =C-o,q,z,=
- =C-d,u=
- =S-=
- =C,M-[,],\=  
- =C-M-=
  - =C-M-b= : switch buffer

*** Frequently used commands, but have inconvenient keymap
- =query-replace=: =M-%=
- =scroll-up/down=: ={C,M}-v=
  - to =C-d,u=
- =revert buffer=

*** Consistent key between OS and emacs
- =M-c,v,z= 

** Proposals
*** Quarantine buffers
Sometimes, I'm afraid of killing buffer because

1. The operation may have been a mistake.
2. Maybe I need the buffer later.

So, quarantine buffers can be useful when I want to keep my buffer list clean but also want's to restore qurantined buffers.
The size of the Quarantine buffer list is limited.
